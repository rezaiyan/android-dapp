# Kickoff: A Decentralized Voting App

Welcome to **Kickoff**, a decentralized voting application built with Android (Jetpack Compose) and blockchain technology! In this project, I demonstrate how to integrate an Android app with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Features
- **Android App**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern and clean UI.
  - Connects to **MetaMask** for user authentication and interaction.
  - Displays a list of candidates, their names, and vote counts.
  - Allows users to cast votes for their favorite candidates.
- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia test network.
  - Stores candidate information (name and votes).
  - Ensures secure voting with validation to prevent duplicate votes.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Web3j for seamless interaction between the Android app and the blockchain.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: Jetpack Compose, Kotlin
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Remix IDE, MetaMask, Infura
- **Integration**: Web3j library

## Learnings and Challenges
This project explores the process of:
1. Writing and deploying a Solidity smart contract.
2. Integrating an Android app with blockchain using Web3j.
3. Authenticating users via MetaMask and managing secure transactions.

I encountered a challenge when implementing the voting functionality due to issues with transaction signing. If you have insights or suggestions, feel free to contribute!

## Contribute
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the app, fix the voting issue, or add new features:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes.
3. Submit a pull request.
